# Square Block Android Interview Exercise
Square (aka Block) mobile coding interview exercise

## Build tools & versions used
I have used Android Studio, Koala, version 2024.1.1.
The target and compile sdk would be 34, the minimum sdk would be 30.

## Steps to run the app
1. Simply run the application via Android Studio onto a device or emulator
2. The application should download the JSON data right away, depending on the connection status
3. If there are no connection found, you can always retry until connection is found
4. After the list of employees are shown, you can refresh, or sort by name and teams.

## What areas of the app did you focus on?
I soley focused on the functionality of the app.
This includes the MVVM architecture and Jetpack Compose UI.

## What was the reason for your focus? What problems were you trying to solve?
I was trying to create a coherent code base that can be scalable, maintainable, as well as testable.

## How long did you spend on this project?
I have spent around five hours in completing this assessment.

## Did you make any trade-offs for this project? What would you have done differently with more time?
The trade offs were primarily based on the image libraries that were used. 
I was debating whether to use Coil of Glide, but at the end, I ended up with Coil due to being convenient with the usage of Jetpack Compose.

## What do you think is the weakest part of your project?
I think the weakest part of the project is the testing side, I didn't really get to cover much as I hoped for.

## Did you copy any code or dependencies? Please make sure to attribute them here!
I didn't copy any code, nor used any dependencies as far as I'm concern.

## Is there any other information youâ€™d like us to know?
Nothing at the moment.
